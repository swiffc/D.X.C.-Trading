# BTMM Trading App - No Authentication Version

## ✅ Deployment Status for Vercel

### What Was Changed
- **Removed Authentication System**: All login/register functionality has been removed
- **Simplified Architecture**: App now runs without user accounts - all data is stored under a single default user
- **Direct Access**: Dashboard is immediately accessible without login requirements

### ✅ Vercel Configuration
Your project is **ready for Vercel deployment** with:
- Proper `vercel.json` configuration
- Node.js backend via `@vercel/node`
- Static frontend assets via `@vercel/static`
- Correct API routing setup

### Required Environment Variables for Vercel
Set these in your Vercel project settings:
```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Database Setup Required
1. Run your existing `database/schema.sql` in Supabase
2. **IMPORTANT**: Run `database/create-default-user.sql` to create the default user
3. Consider disabling RLS policies temporarily if needed for the default user insert

### Removed Dependencies
- `@fastify/jwt` - JWT authentication
- `bcryptjs` - Password hashing

### Security Note
⚠️ **This app is now publicly accessible without authentication**
- All trading data is shared under a single user account
- Consider this for demo/portfolio purposes only
- For production use with real trading data, re-implement authentication

### What Still Works
✅ All core trading functionality:
- Add/edit/delete trades
- Upload screenshots
- View analytics and BTMM analysis
- All trading strategies and market structure tracking

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies (auth packages removed)
npm install

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

### Post-Deployment Steps
1. Verify the default user was created in Supabase
2. Test all trading functionality
3. Upload some test data to verify everything works

The app is now a simplified, publicly accessible trading journal perfect for demonstration purposes.
